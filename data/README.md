# Project Data

Structure of the data folder:
-`ed`: Data generated from the Julia exact diagonalization code generated by [ED Code](https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/tVDiagonalizeParticleEntanglementEntropyEquilibrium) for up to N=14 particles at half-filling and N=16 particles for the three particle entanglement.
-`dmrg`: Data generated from the Julia DMRG code generated by [DMRG Code](https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/tVparticleEEdmrg_julia)
