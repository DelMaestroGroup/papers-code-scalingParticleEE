# Project Data

Structure of the data folder:
- `ed`: Data generated from the Julia exact diagonalization code generated by [ED Code](https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/tVDiagonalizeParticleEntanglementEntropyEquilibrium) for up to N=14 particles at half-filling and N=16 particles for the three particle entanglement.
- `dmrg`: Data generated from the Julia DMRG code generated by [DMRG Code](https://github.com/DelMaestroGroup/tVparticleEEdmrg_julia)
- `coefficients`: Coefficients presented in various tables in the paper
  - `CoeffsFixedn`: Coefficients presented for fixed values of little n and various interactions and alphas
  - `CoeffsFixedratio`: Phi0 and Phi1 coefficients for each fixed ratio at different interactions and alphas
  - `CoeffsFullDataSet`: Can be used to reproduce Fig 11 in the paper for alpha=1 and different interactions, contains each ratio, the corresponding N value, the entanglement divided by N, and Phi0/Phi1 evaluated at each n/N
